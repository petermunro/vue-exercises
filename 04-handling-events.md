# Handling Events

1. Change the message "Send a Gift" to a `<button>` that responds to a click event. The event handler can simply `console.log()` a message.

2. It would be nice to have an `<input>` field that lets you enter the gift to send. Implement this. Make sure you can see the gift selected in the console.

3. What's the difference between the `@change` and `@input` events? Experiment to verify your understanding.

4. Instead of displaying a message in the console that the gift has been sent, have it displayed above the client list.

5. Does pressing 'Enter' send your form? If not, use a Vue _event modifier_ to have the gift sent when the user hits 'Enter'.
