# Rendering Lists

1. Below is a list of clients. Render the list, and display for each client their name, city and country.

   One way to use this data is simply to copy it into your `<script>` element as a JavaScript assignment:

```
let clients = [
  {
    id: 451,
    name: "Dibbert Koepp",
    city: "Carmelaberg",
    country: "Seychelles"
  },
  {
    id: 2001,
    name: "Schinner and Sons",
    city: "Marcelinoland",
    country: "Mozambique"
  },
  { id: 1984,
    name: "Walsh Inc",
    city: "New Clyde",
    country: "Saint Helena" },
  {
    id: 123,
    name: "Donnelly Group",
    city: "North Carolineberg",
    country: "Iceland"
  },
  { id: 2012,
    name: "Kub LLC",
    city: "Strosinland",
    country: "Panama" },
  { id: 11,
    name: "Okuneva Krajcik",
    city: "Jacobston",
    country: "Somalia" },
  {
    id: 20000,
    name: "Wolff, Braun and Hettinger",
    city: "Port Horace",
    country: "Mozambique"
  }
];
```
